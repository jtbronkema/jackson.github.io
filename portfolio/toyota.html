                      <p class="lead ">In our Data Visualization class, we were tasked with using monthly sales data sets and other data found online to
                      create a marketing strategy for Toyota and Lexus. The ultimate goal of the strategy is to increase
                      sales for both companies. With our strategy developed and our visualizations created, we then presented our strategy to relevant stakeholders in a 15-minute video.

                                  One thing that was special about this project was that we were able to leverage descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. As can be seen in the video
                                   and Tableau Storyboard below, we broke down our presentation into three distinct parts: background, analysis,
                                   and future strategies. The purpose of giving a background was to provide the shareholders with an overview of of the current state of each company.
                                   The analysis portion helped to derive insights into what recommendations to suggest. In closing, we give clear data-driven recommendations
                                   to shareholders on practical steps that they can take to increase the revenue of both companies.

                                    Our final recommendations were:
                                    <ol class="lead" >
                                    <li>Both brands should continue to invest heavily into R&D for their alternative fuel, hybrids, and electric vehicles</li>
                                    <li>Lexus should increase marketing for their hybrids, Toyota should continue to develop the RAV-4 Hybrid, and Toyota launch a low-end
                                    SUV</li>
                                    <li>Lexus should focus their marketing for electric vehicles on older customers with higher disposable income through adds on Facebook,
                                     Television, and billboards (places that have high impressions on the older population)</li>
                                    <li>Toyota should use online marketing platforms such as Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter for marketing Sedans and SUVs</li>
                                    <li>Both companies should target men when marketing their hybrids and EVs, since men are more likely to purchase these types of vehicles</li>
                                    </ol>

                                  <p class="lead ">
                                    This project was challenging, but very exciting! I enjoyed working with my partner Pavan Ghantasala as we tackled this intriguing and though-provoking consulting project.
                                    One of the challenges of this project was that we were tasked with providing a strategy for both companies. A very important component of this was that we had to
                                    consider whether or not our suggestions would result in one brand cannibalizing the sales of the other. Given more time, we would have looked at data for
                                    Toyotas current marketing strategy, so that we could confirm whether or not they are already implementing some of the strategies that we suggested. We would also like to take a deeper look into
                                    how COVID-19 has changed the marketing outlook for Toyota Motor Corporation.
