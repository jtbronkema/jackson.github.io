                      <p class="lead ">For the our final exam in Data Visualization, three of my classmates and I were tasked with an open ended consulting project using Tableau. In this project,
                        our task was to do a competitor analysis for a a large corporation of our choosing, using data anlysis from any data that we could find on the web. Along with
                        this, we needed to give a background of how the comany is currently doing and given them recommendations for the future. With all of tis information collated,
                        we then presented our recommended strategies in a 15-minute video presentation.

                      <!-- Explaining our analysis section-->
                      <h2>Our Analysis</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        We opened our analysis by looking at the online video streaming services market (OTT) as a whole. What we found was that:
                        <ul class="lead" >
                          <li>The revenue for the OTT sector is growthing rapidly in recent years and is projected to continue to follow a similar pattern in coming years</li>
                          <li>The household penetration rate of OTT is up 80% since 2014, while the household penetration rate of Cable TV is down 6% over the same time period </li>
                          <li>Ease of use and quality of contentare the most important factors to consumers</li>
                          <li>Price discount, a large movie library, and few and infrequent ads are the most significant factors in retaining subscribers over a long period of time</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                      <h4>Global Scenario</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        As a part of developing our competitive strategy, we knew that we had to look at this problem from a global perspective. What we found was that:
                        <ul class="lead" >
                          <li>Amazon Prime Video has a presence in the highest number of countries (200), while Netflix trails with 190</li>
                          <li>The average global data consumption growth rate acriss all countries is 26.4% per year. This number increases each year and is higher than any other time
                            in hsitory</li>
                          <li>The four countries with the highest consumptiongrowth rate are Nigeria, India, Indonesia, and China </li>
                        </ul>

                      </p>
                      <h4>A look at the Competition</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                       Through our initial research, it quickly became evident that Amazon Prime has many different competitors such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. However, it is obvious
                       Netflix is the only competitor that is superior to Amazon Prime in many different categories. In analyzing the current state of Amazon Prime Video's competition we
                       found that Netflix is outperforming Amazon Prime in 3 areas:
                       <ul class="lead" >
                         <li>Total number of internet searches</li>
                         <li>Impact generated in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (from a consumer perspective)</li>
                         <li>US marketshare in 2021, with a marketshare of 20% compared to Prime's 18%</li>
                         <li>Amount spent on content creation ($12b to $5b)</li>
                         <li>Total percentage of original content on their respective platforms (53% to 12%)</li>
                       </ul>

                      </p>

                      <h4>Content Comparison across Brands</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        A big driver in the online streaming services sector is the amount and quality of content that each company offers to their subscribers. Knowing this, we conducted an
                        analysis to see which companies have the hoghest rated content by IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores. In the aggregate, Amazon Prime had the lowest average IMDb and Rotten
                        Tomato scores. Amazon Prime also has the lowest rated movies by IMDb
                        score for 7+, 13+, and 18+ movies as well.

                      </p>

                      <h4>Content Size and Pricing Metrics</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Amazon Prime has 12,828 total titles and their next closest compeitior, Netlix, only has 3,781. Due to this large selection, Prime offers their subscribers the most total
                        movies, quality movies (IMDb > 6.0) and high quality movies (IMDb > 7.5) per dollar. However, Netlix and Hulu both have more qualoty and high quality moveis per dollar than
                        does Prime. We see a similar trend with total quality movies and total quality TV shows across brands.




                      <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Based on what we found in our data, the things Amazon Prime are doing well is:
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Due to their economies of scale, Amazon is able to keep their costs low and are able to offer their subscribers much more content than their competitors at a
                            lower price</li>
                          <li>Prime offers the highest variety of both TV shows</li>
                          <li>Prime has the most high quality movies compared to the rest of their competitors</li>

                        </ol>

                        <p class="lead ">
                        However, we have many recommendations to Amazon Prime that will help them to gain on their competition. These include
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Focus on emerging countries such as China, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia and market Amazon Prime Video heavily in those countries</li>
                          <li>Begin to make more and better original content. Invest in well-renowned TV show and movie producers to create your content. Then market this!</li>
                          <li>Invest in highly rate TV shows to gain ground on both Netflix and Hulu</li>
                          <li>We have the quantity, so now think quality over quantity with new aquisitions</li>

                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <p class="lead ">
                          I enjoyed working with my classmates to solve this problem. I feel that we gave a fairly comprehensive analysis of the current state of the online video streaming
                          industry as a whole. We were also able to use data to give our client many actionable insights that they could implement. If they take action on what we have
                          consulted them to do, we believe that they will be able to close the gap that exists between them and Netflix and they will also be able to widen the current margin
                          that they hav already created with many of their other competitors. There are also many other things that we would have liked to investigate if we had
                          more time. A few of these further areas of research include:
                            <ul class="lead" >
                              <li>Take a deeper dive into the pricing models of Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ to see ways that we can gain an advantage</li>
                              <li>Forecast future sales of each company based on current scenario and simulate future sales with our changes in place</li>
                              <li>Look into specific statistics for the top 20% of the best content on all streaming services to see how these titles affect subscriptions and viewership</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
