                      <p class="lead ">For our final exam in Data Visualization, three of my classmates and I were tasked with an open-ended consulting project using Tableau. In this project,
                        our task was to complete a competitor analysis for a a large corporation of our choosing, using any data available to us on the web. We were also required to give a background
                        of the current state of the company and give recommendations for the future. We presented our recommended strategies in a 15-minute video presentation.

                      <!-- Explaining our analysis section-->
                      <h2>Our Analysis</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        We opened our analysis by looking at the online video streaming services market (OTT) as a whole. We found that:
                        <ul class="lead" >
                          <li>The revenue for the OTT sector has grown rapidly in recent years and is projected to follow a similar pattern in coming years</li>
                          <li>The household penetration rate of OTT is up 80% since 2014, while the household penetration rate of Cable TV is down 6% over the same time period</li>
                          <li>On average, ease of use and quality of content are the most important factors to consumers</li>
                          <li>Price discount, a large movie library, and few and infrequent advertisements are the most significant factors in retaining subscribers over a long period of time</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>

                      <h4>Global Scenario</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        In developing our competitive strategy, we understood the importance of looking at this problem from a global perspective. What we found was that:
                        <ul class="lead" >
                          <li>Amazon Prime Video has a presence in the highest number of countries (200), while Netflix trails with 190</li>
                          <li>The average global data consumption growth rate across all countries is 26.4% per year. This number increases each year and is higher than any other time
                            in hsitory</li>
                          <li>The four countries with the highest consumption growth rate last year were Nigeria, India, Indonesia, and China</li>
                        </ul>

                      </p>
                      <h4>A look at the Competition</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                       Amazon Prime's main competitors are Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. However, initial researched showed us that Netflix is the only competitor that is superior to Amazon Prime across many different categories.
                       In analyzing the current state of Amazon Prime Video's competition we found that Netflix is outperforming Amazon Prime in 5 key areas. These include:
                       <ol class="lead" >
                         <li>The total number of internet searches of their platform</li>
                         <li>The impact generated in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (from a consumer perspective)</li>
                         <li> The US marketshare in 2021, with a marketshare of 20% compared to Prime's 18%</li>
                         <li>The amount spent on content creation ($12b to $5b) last year</li>
                         <li>THe total percentage of original content on their respective platforms (53% to 12%)</li>
                       </ol>

                      </p>

                      <h4>Content Comparison across Brands</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        A big driver in the online streaming services sector is the amount and quality of content that each company offers to their subscribers. Knowing this, analyzed which companies have the highest rated content by
                        IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores. In the aggregate, Amazon Prime had the lowest average IMDb and Rotten Tomato scores when comparing to Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+. Amazon Prime also has the lowest rated movies by IMDb
                        score for 7+, 13+, and 18+ movies as well.

                      </p>

                      <h4>Content Size and Pricing Metrics</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Amazon Prime has 12,828 total titles and their next closest compeitior, Netlix, only has 3,781. Due to their large selection, Prime offers their subscribers the greatest number of
                        movies, quality movies (IMDb > 6.0) and high quality movies (IMDb > 7.5) per dollar. However, Netlix and Hulu both have more quality and high quality TV shows per dollar than
                        Prime does.




                      <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Based on what we found in our data, the things Amazon Prime is doing well is:
                          </p>
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Due to their economies of scale, Amazon is able to keep their costs low and are offer their subscribers much more content than their competitors, they also offer this content at a
                            lower price than their competitors</li>
                          <li>Prime offers the highest variety of both TV shows and movies</li>
                          <li>Prime has the greatest number of highly rated movies in the industry</li>

                        </ol>

                        <p class="lead ">
                        However, we have many recommendations to Amazon Prime that we believe will help them to close the gap on Netlix and widen the gap that exists between them and their other competitors. These include:
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Focus on emerging countries such as China, Nigeria, India, and Indonesia and market Amazon Prime Video heavily in those countries</li>
                          <li>Begin to make more and better original content. Invest in well-renowned producers to create your content, then market this!</li>
                          <li>Invest in highly rated TV shows</li>
                          <li>Prime has the quantity, so now think quality over quantity with new aquisitions</li>

                        </ol>
                        </p>

                        <p class="lead ">
                          I enjoyed working with my classmates to solve this problem. We were able to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of the online video streaming
                          industry. We were also able to use data to give our client many actionable insights that they could implement. If they take action on what we have
                          consulted them to do, they will be able to close the gap that exists between them and Netflix and they will also be able to widen the current margin
                          that they built between them and their their other competitors. There are also many other things that we would have liked to investigate if we had
                          more time. A few of these further areas of research are:
                            <ol class="lead" >
                              <li>Take a deeper dive into the pricing models of Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ to see ways that we can gain an advantage</li>
                              <li>Forecast future sales of each company based on the current scenario and simulate future sales with our changes in place</li>
                              <li>Run an analysis on the top 20% of content on each platform, so that we can see how the quality content on each platform affects subscriptions and viewership</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
