                        In my computing for Analytics class, I had the opportunity to learn about many different algorithms that have enabled me to become a more efficient programmer in Python. I
                        was able to build programming in 5 main areas: graph algorithms, dynammic programming, linear/integer/convex programming, and machine learning. In this project, which was the final
                        exam deliverable for this course, I put these skills to the test. My partner and I were tasked with creating an open-ended business scenario and using three out of the four
                        programming techniques listed above to deliver business insights.

                      <h2>Business Scenario</h2>
                      <p class="lead">
                        We have just recently been hired on as consultants for the newly created airline company - Upstart Airlines. Upstart offers flights to many different cities in the United States.
                        Based in New York City, NY, Upstart Airlines currently offer flights from the 20 largest cities in the United States by population. Along with providing flights, they also
                        build their own planes. Our goal as consultants is to use the techniques we learned in class to extract business insights about two different aspects of the business. First, the company is
                        considering expanding and building a new plane production facility in one of the 20 cities where we offer flights. We will use information from the ArcGIS Hub dataset, to decide which cities
                        are the best candidates to build our factory in. We have used linear programming, k-means clustering, and SVM as tools to help us identify which cities would be the best candidates for building
                        the new factory. Second, we have used our dataset to track different costs and variables associated with travel. For example, in the graph algorithm, we are calculating the total distance
                        traveled and fuel costs for each city that we fly out of in each week.

                          This was a challenging project, but I am glad that I was able apply the techniques that I learned in class to a real business scenario. Through this project, I definitely grew in my ability to
                          code in python. I also improved on my problem solving skills within the framework of the python modules Networkx, pulp, statsmodels.api, and sklearn. I believe that this project gives evidence to
                          my ability to use effectively use python in solving anlytics problems. I look forward to continuing to learn how to apply these modules to complex problems in the future!
