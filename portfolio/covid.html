                      <!-- Explaining our analysis section-->
                      <h2>Our Analysis</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Our data analysis consisted of four distinct parts that worked together to bring a comprehensive solutions to our client. First, analyzed the global
                        implications of the virus and how the United States has done with controlling the virus in comparison to other countrues around the world. Next, we
                        did research to confirm the efficacy of vaccines. Following this, we did variant analysis in order to understand how well vaccines perform against different
                        variants. Lastly, we looked at the economic implications of lockdowns, whether or not masks are effective, and how the virus is affecting Americans socially
                        and pshycologically.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Global Scenario</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        We wanted to look at how contries around the world were managing the COVID-19 pandemic, so that we could understand the areas that the United States was succeeding
                        and some strategies that we could suggest for improvement. The metrics we looked at were the stringency index (how stringent the policies of each country were against
                        COVID), the number of Hostpital beds per 1000 people, and compared those statistics to total cases and total deaths. From this, we were unable to find a correlation
                        between stringeny or hospital beds to the number of cases or deaths. However, this research gave us a better perspective into how different countries are fairing against
                        the pandemic.

                      <h4>Vaccine Efficacy</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                       During our research into the effectiveness of the vaccines released in the United States we found that:
                       <ol class="lead" >
                         <li>The initial result of the release of the vaccine was a decrease in the number of new cases and deaths from COVID-19</li>
                         <li>After the intial decrease in deaths and new cases, the number of cases has increased steadily once again in recent months </li>
                         <li>People are not getting vaccinated at as high of a rate as they were, the growth rate of vaccination rate began to level off in May of 2021 </li>
                         <li>The growth rate of cases is increasing at a higher rate in previous months than the vaccination rate</li>
                       </ol>
                       <p class="lead ">
                       From this, we can garner that the vaccines were very effictive in the early stages of their release, but just a few months later, they are no longer as affective. This can
                       be attributed to low long-term efficacy, or to the arrival of new variants. In the next section, took a deeper dive into vaccine efficacy and COVID-19 variants to try to
                       understand which it is.
                      </p>
                      </p>

                      <h4>Variant Analysis</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Through our research and data analysis, it became evident very quickly that COVID-19 variants grow and spread very quickly in the United States. Through our variant analysis
                        we found:
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>the Delta
                          variant only made up roughly 1% of the total COVID-19 cases that were in the US on May 2nd of 2021. By August 1st 83.4% of the cases in the US were the Delta
                          Variant.</li>
                          <li>The Delta Variant is 2.37 times as deadly as the orginal strain</li>
                          <li>The Delta Variant is 1.97 times as transmissible as the origninal strain</li>
                          <li>For every person who is infected with the Delta Variant, we can expect them to infect 7 people on average, making it more transmissible than HIV SARS and
                            Ebola. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="lead ">
                        We also conducted research to compare the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer vaccines. The result of this was that the Moderna and Pfizer
                        vaccines were found to be 11% more effecgive against the Delta Variant than Johnson & Johnson.

                        </p>
                      </p>

                      <h4>Lockdowns, and Social and Psychological Effects</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Before giving our recommendations, we did a study on Nordic countries to compare the results of lockdowns and economic growth during the pandemic. We found that:
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Sweden had anywhere from three to eight times as many deaths as the other three nordic countries. This gives evidence to the efficacy of lockdowns, since
                          Sweden haad very little restrictions and Denmark, Finland, and Norway did.</li>
                          <li>Despite not locking down, Sweden did not seem to outperform the other Nordic countries that did (by per capita GDP since March 2020)</li>
                          <li>Common research also shows that wearing non-cloth masks reduces the spread of the virus by 65%</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="lead ">
                        However, there seem to be some negative Social and Psychological Effects of lockdowns and COVID-19 as a whole. As a result of the pandemic:
                        <ul class="lead" >
                          <li>45% of people in the US are experiencing increased finacial stress</li>
                          <li>41% of people say that they are more stressed about work</li>
                          <li>60% of people say that they are more stressed than they were as a result of lockdowns</li>
                        </ul>

                        </p>
                      </p>



                      <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        With the Analysis conducted, our recommendations to the US Government were as follows:
                        <ol class="lead" >
                          <li>Continue to keep a global perspective and research what is working and not working in other countries with similar characteristics the US</li>
                          <li>Continue to market the vaccines, as they are very effective against the original strand</li>
                          <li>Market the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines over the Johnson & Johnson, since they are 11% more effective against the more dangerous Delta Variant</li>
                          <li>Make masks mandatory until the data shows that they are no longer a significant factor in stopping the spread of COVID-19</li>
                          <li>Try to lockdown for as short of periods as possible. This slows the spread of the virus, but the social and psychological results of lockdowns are severe</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>Conclusion and Areas of Continued Research</h2>

                        <p class="lead ">
                          This project was very challenging because there is a lot stochasticity involved in trying to find solutions to a problem with so many different variables. We had
                          the advantage of having a few months of data on the virus when making our recommendations to our client. I feel that we have provided many powerful and data-driven
                          solutions that should be implememented going forward. With a problem of this nature, there are also many other things that we would have liked to investigate if we had
                          more time. A few of these further areas of research include:
                            <ol class="lead" >
                              <li>Run a regression model using the global variables such as stringency, hospital beds per 1000 people, and economic support to predict the number of cases or
                                deaths and see which independent variables are statistically significant</li>
                              <li>Research how the Delta Variant would have affected the US if the majority of people did not have the vaccine prior to contracting Delta</li>
                              <li>Get statistics on the affects of COVID by age group. This could give us an ideo of how to handle the virus in schools, Uiversities, and Nursing Homes, etc.</li>
                              <li>Research further the economic impact of government support in the long-term, with a data-driven cost-benefit analysis</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
