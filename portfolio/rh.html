                      <p class="lead ">
                        Working with an undisclosed industry leader in the high-end home-furnishing industry, we modeled and forecasted ocean shipping volume
                        by individual shipping lane for the furniture that our sponsor has imported into the United States on a month basis. This model and
                        forecast will be used in the future by decision makers to stipulate the shipping volume that they need their partner carriers to
                        import from Asia into the United States by lane. This forecast will mitigate the amount of risk our client is exposed to when negotiating
                        shipping contracts with the ocean carriers that transport their products. Producing a robust model that can accurately predict future shipping
                        volume is vital to our client because, prior to our work, they had no point of reference as to the amount of lane-wise shipping volume to
                        expect each month. We used ARIMA and ETS models on the past seven years of lane-wise monthly shipping volume data to build a forecast for
                        the next twelve months. We were able to effectively model the company's largest lanes by aggregate volume, which accounted for 65% of the
                        total shipping volume our sponsor has imported in the past seven fiscal years. We chose the ARIMA and ETS models in R because of their
                        high performance and ease of replicability over data of different shipping lanes. The name of our client is redacted due to the fact that I
                        signed an NDA.

                      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        I have included a PDF of the research that we were able to complete during this project. Our work was accepted to the MWDSI Conference and We had the opportunity
                        to present our findings at that conference. We also created a poster outlining our work during this project and it was accepted to the INFORMS Conference in Houston, Texas.
                        Throughout this paper, we highlight the problem we solved for our client, created an in-depth literature review, and covered our methodoly and model building. We also highlight
                        our model evaluation and the business result that we were able to deliver to our client.

                        With the conclusion of our work, we were able to present our final results to the client. Here is our PowerPoint
                        Presentation outlining the process we took to deliver the final business result to the client.

                        but it was still an honor to have our work accepted at this conference. You can zoom in to read more.

                        This was a meaningful project, and it was exciting to deliver a meaningful business result to our client. I enjoyed working on this team and building a deeper understanding of
                        analytics consulting. If you want more information about this project or would like to see the R code that we wrote for this project, please go my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/am11917/NBA_Prediction_Analytics" target="_blank">here</a>.
