                      <p class="lead ">
                        The sports gambling industry has seen a rapid ascent in recent years. This is evident by the fact that there has been a large increase in the amount of money spent on sports gambling and the
                        number of people who participate in sports betting both online and in casinos in recent years. With this knowledge, my group and I decided to create an all inclusive sports betting information
                        hub in our Using R for Analytics class. We used the Shiny package through R to create this application. Some of the features of our dashboard include current twitter feeds
                        with up-to-date information on the NBA, recent team and player statistics, a player analytics profile, player clustering analysis, and a single game predictor model with a
                        probability of the winner.

                      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        I have included the final document that we submitted for this project with links to our dashboard, our R codes, and a video submission that we created for this project.
                        This PDF highlights the inspiration for our project and gives a brief overview. We also elaborate on why we created this application, as well as the business and analytics
                        problems it solves. We have also included a brief description of our methodology selection and the model that we built. The application and video are also included within this web
                        page as well and can be accessed by scrolling down the page. Our video speaks more to our methodology selection and model.

                      <h2>Our Application</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Here is our analytics dashboard. For best usage and rendering of the app, go to: <a href="https://amaheshw.shinyapps.io/NBA_Team6/" target="_blank">NBA Analytics Dashboard</a>. Also,
                        for best rendering of the application within the framework of this current page, select the three horizontal lines within the application to expand the content on each page of the dashboard.
                        To see our code, please visit this GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/am11917/NBA_Prediction_Analytics" target="_blank">am11917</a>. If you do not have a strong connection, the
                        dashboard may take a few minutes load. Also, the clustering analysis portion of the app usually takes 10-15 seconds to load.

                      <h2>Functionality</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        The dashboard consists of 5 pages. The first page includes hype video and informs the viewer on the NBA. The second page is the Team Profile. The team profile page gives team statistics,
                        player statistics, and salary information for each NBA team. The players profile page allows users to compare the worth of different NBA players in a one-vs-one manner using analytical measures.
                         In the fourth page of the application, we have cluster analysis. This aspect of the application allows users to cluster all current NBA players based on their total worth to a team.
                         This is a great application for NBA executives or fantasy basketball players to use to pick the NBA players to their team that truly add the most value to their teams. The most importatnt
                         aspect of our application is in the final page. This is a game prediction tool. For any possible match-up of NBA teams, this application uses logistic regression to predict which team will win
                         and it also gives the probability that that team will win.

                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        This is my favorite project that I was able to complete during my time at Purdue. This is a very powerful application and my teammates and I were able to create it in less than a week. I really
                        enjoyed using R, Shiny, supervised and unsupervised learing, and ML alrorithms like Neural Networks, Boosting, and Random Forests to create our NBA Analytics Dashboard!
