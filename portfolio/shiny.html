                      <p class="lead ">
                        The sports gambling industry has seen a rapid ascent in recent years. This is evident in the fact that there has been a large increase in the amount of money spent in sports gambling and the
                        number of people who participate in sports betting both online and in casinos. With this knowledge me and three of my classmates decided to create an all inclusive sports betting information
                        hob in our Using R for Analytics class. To create this application, we used the Shiny package through R. Some of the features that we have included in this application are current twitter feeds
                        with up-to-date information on the NBA, recent team and player statistics, a player profile that compares players against each other, clustering analysis, and single game predictor tool with a
                        probability of the winner.

                      <p class="lead ">
                        Here is the final document that we submitted for this project which includes links to our final application, our R codes, and a video that we created for this project.
                        This PDF outlines highlights the inspiration for our project and gives a brief overview. We also elaborate on why we created this application, the business and analytics
                        problem it solves. This PDF also includes a brief description of our methodology selection and the model that we built.

                      <p class="lead ">
                        Here is our application. For best usage and rendering of the app, go to: <a href="https://amaheshw.shinyapps.io/NBA_Team6/" target="_blank">NBA Analytics Dashboard</a>. Also, for best rendering of the
                        application within the framework of this current page, select the three horizontal lines within the application to exapand the content on each page of the dashboard. For our code, please
                        visit this GitHub Repository: <a href="https://github.com/am11917/NBA_Prediction_Analytics" target="_blank">am11917</a>. If you do not have a stron connection, the dashboard may take a few minutes
                        load. Also, the clustering analysis portion of the app using takes 10 seconds to render.

                      <h2>Application Functionality</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        Our analytics dashboard consists of 5 pages. The first page includes hype video and gives a bief description of the NBA to those who do not know much about the NBA. The second page
                        is the Team Profile. The team profile page gives team statistics, player statistics, and salary information for each NBA team. The Players Profile page allows users to compare the worht of
                        different NBA players in a one-vs-one manner using deep statistics. There is also page to look at many different statistics for each player without comparing them to another player. In the fourth
                        page of the application, we have cluster analysis. This aspect of the application allows users to cluster all current NBA players based on their total worth to a team. This is a great application
                        for NBA executives or Fantasy Basketball players to use in order to pick the NBA players to their team truly have the most value. The most importatnt aspect of our application is in the final
                        page. This is a game predictiontool. For any possible match-up of NBA teams, or tool uses logistic regression in order to predict which team will win and it also gives the probability that that
                        team will win.

                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        This is my favorite project that I was able to complete during my time at Purdue. This is a very powerful application and my teammates and I were able to create it in less than a week. I really
                        enjoyed using R, Shiny, supervised and unsupervised learing, and ML alrorithms like Neural Networks, Boosting, and Random Forests to create our NBA Analytics Dashboard.
