                      <p class="lead ">
                        The sports gambling industry has seen a rapid ascent in recent years. This is evident by the fact that there has been a large increase in the amount of money spent on sports gambling and that the
                        number of people who participate in sports betting both online and in casinos has also increased in recent years. With this knowledge, our group decided to create an all-inclusive sports betting information
                        hub in our Using R for Analytics class. We used the Shiny package in R to create this application. Some of the features of our dashboard include current twitter feeds
                        with up-to-date information on the NBA, recent team and player statistics, a player analytics profile, player clustering analysis, and a single game prediction model that gives the predicted winner of a head-to-head
                        matchup.

                      <h2>Project Overview</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        I have included the final document that we submitted for this project with links to our dashboard, our R codes, and a video submission that we created for this project.
                        This PDF highlights the inspiration for our project and gives a brief overview. We also elaborate on why we created this application, as well as the business and analytics
                        problems it solves. We have also included a brief description of our methodology selection and model building. The application and video are embedded in this webpage
                        as well. Our video gives deeper insight into our model building methodology and model accuracy.

                      <p class="lead ">
                        Here is our analytics dashboard. For best usage and rendering of the app, go to: <a href="https://amaheshw.shinyapps.io/NBA_Team6/" target="_blank">NBA Analytics Dashboard</a>. Also,
                        for best rendering of the application within the framework of this current page, select the three horizontal lines within the application to expand the content on each page of the dashboard.
                         If you do not have a strong connection, the dashboard may take a few minutes load. Also, the clustering analysis portion of the app usually takes 10-15 seconds to load. To see our code,

                      <h2>Functionality</h2>
                      <p class="lead ">
                        The dashboard consists of 5 pages. The first page includes an NBA hype video and informs the casual viewer on what the NBA is. The second page is the Team Profile. The Team Profile page gives team statistics,
                        player statistics, and salary information for each NBA team. The Players Profile page allows users to compare the worth of different NBA players in a one-vs-one manner using analytical measures.
                         In the fourth page of the application, we have Cluster Analysis. This page allows users to cluster all current NBA players based on their total worth to a team.
                         This page is especially useful for NBA executives or fantasy basketball players to use to pick the NBA players to their team that truly add the most value. The most important
                         aspect of our application is in the final page. This is a game prediction tool. For any possible match-up of NBA teams, this application uses logistic regression to predict which team will win
                         and it also gives the probability that that team will win as well.

                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                      <p class="lead ">
                        This is my favorite project that I was able to complete during my time at Purdue. This application is very powerful, and my teammates and I were able to create it in less than a week. I really
                        enjoyed using R, Shiny, supervised and unsupervised learning, and ML algorithms like Neural Networks, Boosting, and Random Forests to create our NBA Analytics Dashboard!
